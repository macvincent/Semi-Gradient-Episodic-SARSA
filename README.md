# Semi-Gradient Episodic SARSA

Here, we use the Semi-Gradient Episodic SARSA Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train an agent to complete OpenAI Gym's implementation of the classic Mountain Car control task.

## Running the tracker
1. Clone the project repository

```
git clone https://github.com/macvincent/Semi-Gradient-Episodic-SARSA.git
```
2. Install required dependencies, preferably from a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment), by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. To train agent run this command:
```
python3 train.py
```
